# Hi there 👋  

🚀 I'm Aishwarya, a data engineer with 4.5+ years of experience designing scalable data pipelines, building ETL workflows, and working with big data systems across cloud platforms.

📚 Currently pursuing my **Master’s in Computer Science** at **Texas A&M University–Kingsville**, where I continue to deepen my skills in distributed processing, cloud architecture, and data platform engineering.

💻 Skilled in **SQL, Python, PySpark, Kafka, Airflow, and cloud services (AWS & Azure)** with experience in data ingestion, transformation, orchestration, and storage optimization.

📊 I specialize in building end-to-end data systems and occasionally use tools like Tableau and Power BI to validate or present results when needed.

🔍 I’m currently working on projects involving real-time streaming, batch processing, orchestration, and cloud-based pipeline design, while actively exploring data engineering opportunities.

⚡ Beyond pipeline development, I enjoy solving complex data problems—whether it’s optimizing workflows or turning results into clear insights.
