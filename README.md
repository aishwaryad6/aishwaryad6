# Hi there 👋  

🚀 I’m **Aishwarya**, a data engineering and analytics professional with **4.5+ years of experience** working on data pipelines, ETL workflows, and analytics systems across cloud platforms. I enjoy building data systems that are reliable, scalable, and practical to use.

📚 I’m currently pursuing my **Master’s in Computer Science at Texas A&M University-Kingsville**, where I’m continuing to strengthen my skills in distributed systems, cloud architecture, and data platform engineering.

💻 I work regularly with **SQL, Python, PySpark, Kafka, Airflow**, and cloud services across **AWS, Azure, and GCP**, with hands-on experience in data ingestion, transformation, orchestration, and storage optimization.

📊 I enjoy building **end-to-end data systems** and use BI tools like **Tableau and Power BI** to validate results, explore trends, and communicate insights clearly.

🔍 At the moment, I’m working on projects involving **real-time streaming, batch processing, orchestration, and cloud-based pipeline design**, and I’m actively exploring data engineering opportunities.

⚡ Outside of pipeline development, I enjoy solving complex data problems—whether that means optimizing workflows, improving performance, or turning raw data into clear, meaningful insights.
